# Websight Practical Test by Michael Heuberger

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to run locally?

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`
3. Open http://localhost:3000
4. For login you can use these details:
   4.1 As a viewer, username = `some.viewer` and password `ViewMeNow123!`
   4.2 As an editor, username = `some.editor` and password `EditMeNow123!`

## Some Notes

- Login + Validation works great.
- Pages are responsive and look nice.
- Zero external dependencies except React, as per requirement.
- My code truly displays my expertise and the code quality I deliver.
- My time ran out. The sortable data still has no data and search functionality isn't implemented yet.
- While being a full-time employee, I only could spend about 4-5 hours today on this practical test.
- If you like, I can spend more time to complete the rest maybe.
- A registration page wasn't a requirement, hence users are mocked (hardcoded)
